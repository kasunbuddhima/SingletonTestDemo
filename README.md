# SingletonTestDemo
Singleton design pattern is the simplest design pattern we can found. It allows only to create only one instance at a time from the given class.

e.g. clipboard in windows and mobile devices

A singleton class,

*Should be a private class.

*provides a global access point to the class (private static).
